          <h2>Blogging</h2>
          <p>I really believe this that everyone has the power to do something great, all they need to do is start working and remove all excuses. I write educational blogs to help people by sharing my knowledge. Blogging didnâ€™t always come easy for me.
            It worked to reach this level.</p>

          <h2>Writing</h2>
          <p>I have always considered my relationship with writing to be very insignificant. Although I enjoy spending time verbally expressing my thoughts and feelings to others, it becomes difficult when these thoughts and feelings are expressed
            through writing.</p>

          <h2>Video Editing</h2>
          <p>Video editing has gone a long way in technology. It has come from just putting pieces of a film together into adding sound effects, adding filters and adding captions or pictures into the film. I would love to be in as a video editor as
            it advances in time.</p>

          <h2>Web Designing</h2>
          <p>The job of a Web designer is thrilling as well as adventurous because every day there is new task to do. However, every web designer works individually, but there is team of designers who work together and bound to
            collaborate with each other.</p>

              managers.

              Code touches every single person in the organization and makes a difference to every single user that touches it (for good or bad).</p>

            <h2>Good bug reports lead to great bug fixes</h2>
            <p>s a tester/developer, once you find a bug in the system under test, the logical step is to either fix it (if itâ€™s really that small ðŸ˜‰) or to write a bug in the bug tracking system of your choice. This allows yourself or your
              colleagues to take a look and fix the issue.
              A well written bug report is an unsung saviour that saves all involved stakeholders from a possible headache-inducing ordeal.</p>

        <h2>Front End Developer</h2>
        <p>Long before I graduated from university with a bachelor's degree, design has always been my passion. Seeing the works from the great designers from the books, really makes me excited and inspired. Not just limited to website designs, but
          also graphic, product. Even now, I can spend hours just browsing through the pages on the internet, looking for inspiration and ideas from other designers. But inspiration can come not just from previous designs, but sometimes I look for
          ideas from my everyday life. Well probably itâ€™s because design has become a major part of my life.</p>
